# BitMEXWebsocket
Several Projects to show how to use BitMEX Websocket

In this repository we want to provide some example of use of BitMEX with Websocket

The Websocket Connection to BitMEX allows to get LIVE update of many of the Instruments, Quotes, OrderBooks, Trades, Orders, Positions and so on.

The content will be separated in different projects to keep it more simple. Although all projects will contain some common base of the code they will cover different objects.

Currently the following streams are covered:

- CONNECTED
- QUOTE
- TRADE
